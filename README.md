# Cef3D

This was a side project when I was developing my hobby engine. A year later I decided to resurrect it and make it "Awesomium" alternative.
It's very early now but I hope to progress soon.

# How to build
Currently I'm working on Windows so it only builds on Windows 10.
* Clone the repository
* Download the CEF distribution [here](http://opensource.spotify.com/cefbuilds/cef_binary_3.2704.1434.gec3e9ed_windows64.tar.bz2)
* Copy "Debug" "Release" and "Resources" folders to cef3D/Cef,
* Run CMake
* Open the solution(.sln) and build.
